In this 80's style Wargames tribute retro-nuclear war simulation, you play PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, and you have to save America from the Commies and their nuclear missiles with clever maths! Yes it's edumacational AND entertaining!

Splendid Strike puts YOU in the hot seat during a nuclear confrontation with North Korea. Fire off Anti-Ballistic Missiles in the hope of defeating enemy rockets, but don't run out of missiles before they've all been shot down! This game teaches kids and Presidents alike about simple maths, statistics, AND the horrors of nuclear warfare! How's THAT for value for money?

NB - It's STRONGLY RECCOMENDED to run Splendid-Strike-colour.py rather than Splendid-strike, unless it doesn't work of course.
The colour version has a lot of bugs fixed and some kick-ass graphics!

invote with 
python splendidstrike-colour.py
