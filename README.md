In this 80's style Wargames tribute retro-nuclear war simulation, you play PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, and you have to save America from the Commies and their nuclear missiles with clever maths! Yes it's edumacational AND entertaining!

It can teach kids and Presidents alike about both simple maths AND the horrors of nuclear warfare (spoiler: winning is very, very hard, if not statistically impossible, although a "You won" type screen has been included).
